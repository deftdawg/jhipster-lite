# Kipe Expression

Kipe can be pronounced, in french, as "qui peu" which means: who can.  

It is an authorization evaluation mechanism build on top of spring security. Kipe is there to ease business facing authorization checks.  

To do so, you'll have to define spring beans (`@Component` or `@Service`) implementing `AccessChecker<T>`:

```
@Component
class KipeDummyAccessChecker implements AccessChecker<KipeDummy> {

  @Override
  public boolean can(AccessContext<KipeDummy> access) {
    //TODO: your business authorization logic
  }
}
```

Kipe's only job is to call the `AccessChecker` for your object class.
